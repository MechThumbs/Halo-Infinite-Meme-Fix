# Halo-Infinite-Meme-Fix
Fix Halo The Memer Way
First off I want to thank the team at 343 and Microsoft for making Infinite work with Linux. Halo has been a an inspiration to a lot of people including me. This is a fix for the intro loading freezing then crashing. It's a simple fix that i stumbled upon in the funniest way possible!


If you could I would appreciate it if you would support me here

Open up the videos folder

You will see intro.mp4 and Startup_Sequence_Loading.mp4
These videos can be modified! It works with Linux and Windows.

For the fix for Linux is to just delete
"Startup_Sequence_Loading.mp4"

Your game will load like normal! Wasn't that easy!

FIX YOUR GAME 343 and Microsoft Damn....

if you want to have fun like I did you can edit these video and swap them for others. Just remember to change the name to the corresponding name. You will see the video play like this!

This one reminds me that I need to stop playing this game and get to work. All it does tho is make me laugh!

The intro Video is 20 seconds long. I don't know what would happen if you had a longer video. The fun is you can always try something. Just let us know here! Please. You can add to this all you like. I want to see what you all create! i know its going to be funnier than what I can create!
